# react-async-starter

This starter kit contains the simplest app ever but it covers a great async flow thanks to `redux-thunk`, `ES7 Async Function` and `fetch`. Routing is ready with `redux-router` and **Hot Reloading** is working well thanks to `react-hot-loader 3`

## Usage

### Run it

```
git clone https://github.com/didierfranc/react-async-starter.git
npm install
npm start
```

### Build a production bundle

```
npm run build
```
